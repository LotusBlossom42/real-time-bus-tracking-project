# Real Time Bus Tracker
Using external APIs from Google Maps and MBTA (Massachussetts Bay Transportation Authority), 
we are able to see Boston NBTA's bus system update in real time, every 15 seconds. 
This specific route tracks busses going to and from MIT & Harvard.

## How to Run
Clone this repo locally and drag and drop the index.html file into the address bar of your browser. 
Hit enter and you should see a Google Map background with red and blue bus markers moving locations every 15 seconds. 

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
I might add search functionality for other routes in the area, and have the user be able to input the desired route,
and see the map and bus icons update for that specific route.  
In addition, the user would be able to input a city name, and have the map and animations apply to that city.
